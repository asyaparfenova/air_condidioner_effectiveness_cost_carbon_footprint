# How much does 1°C cost you and nature

This is my final project in SPICED Academy Data Science Bootcamp. It aims to calculate the effectiveness, cost and carbon footprint of using a portable air conditioner unit using the data from smart home sensors.
More detailed story and results of this project you can find in the [Presentation](https://github.com/asyaparfenova/air_condidioner_effectiveness_cost_carbon_footprint/blob/main/presentation_print_format.pdf)

## Introduction

Its official title sounds pretty general, when actually it was calculating  the effectiveness, cost
and carbon footprint of using a very particular portable air conditioner unit in a very
particular apartment that belonged to my friend Sasha.

Let's look the story behind it:

**So, despite the abundance of raw data, some Sasha's questions remained unanswered. in particular:**
- *How hotter it would actually be in his apartment without an air conditioner?*
- *How much does it cost to cool his flat for 1°C for 1 hour?*
- *What is the carbon footprint of cooling the flat for 1°C for 1 hour?*

Obviously, a detailed data analysis and even some machine learning techniques were needed to answer them. That is how an idea of this project was born.
